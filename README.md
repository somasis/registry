# registry tweaks

registry tweaks for Windows 8 that I use. most of them should be compatible with Windows 7 or Vista as well, don't quote me on that though.

## installation

installation is simple.

1. clone the repository
    - [with the GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) program if you prefer. there should be a "Clone in Desktop" button near the clone URL.
    - otherwise, just do it with `git`. `git clone https://github.com/Somasis/registry.git` should do the trick.
2. go to the folder you cloned it to
3. double click the registry files you want to install

if it makes you feel better, i promise from the bottom of my heart that i didn't put any viruses in the files. if you don't believe me just read the files for yourself.

## credits

some of them are borrowed from random forum posts, modified from them, etc.

this repo is more or less for my own use so i can keep them in one general area, but if you think you wrote something let me know and i'll credit you.
